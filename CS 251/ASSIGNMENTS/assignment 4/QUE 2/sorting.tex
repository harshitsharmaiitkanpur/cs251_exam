\section{Introduction}
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science useful in numerous applications. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the output should provide a non-decreasing sequence of numbers as output. More formally, we define a sorting problem as follows [1],\\
\textbf{Input}: A sequence of \textit{n} numbers $\langle a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} \rangle$.
\textbf{Output}:A  reordered sequence (of  size  \textit{n}) $\langle a^{'}_{1},a^{'}_{2},...,a^{'}_{n} \rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a^{'}_{1} \leq a^{'}_{2} \leq ... \leq a^{'}_{n}$.\\
Consider the following example. Given an input sequence $\langle8, 34, 7, 9, 15, 91, 15\rangle$, a sorting algorithm should return $\langle7, 8, 9, 15, 15, 34, 91\rangle$ as output.

A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted many researchers who contributed with innovative algorithms to solve the problem of sorting \textit{efficiently} [3]. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on primarily on two aspects,
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity} is a formalism that captures running time of an algorithm in terms of the input size. Normally, \textit{asymptotic} behavior on the input size is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity} is a formalism that captures amount of memory used by an algorithm in terms of input size. Like time complexity analysis, asymptotic analysis is used for space complexity.
\end{itemize}
In the branch of algorithms and complexity in computer science, space complexity takes a back seat compared to time
complexity. Recently, another parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption has become popular. Roy et al. [4] proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting algorithms.

One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{element comparison are commonly known as comparison based sorting algorithms}. In this document we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly used comparison based sorting algorithm
[2]. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on \textit{divide-and-conquer} paradigm of algorithm design. Further, we will derive the lower bound of any comparison based sorting algorithm to be $\Omega(n\hspace{.15cm}$log$_{2}n)$ for an input size of \textit{n}.


\section{Quicksort}
Quicksort is designed as a three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting an input sequence in an array [1]. For any given subarray, \textit{A$[i..j]$}, the process is as follows,

\textbf{Divide}: The array \textit{A$[i..j]$} is partitioned into two sub-arrays \textit{A$[i..k]$} and \textit{A$[k + 1..j]$} such that all elements in \textit{A$[i..k]$} is less than or equal to all elements in \textit{A$[k+1..j]$}. A partitioning procedure is called to determine \textit{k} such that at the end of partitioning, the element at the \textit{$k^{th}$} position (i.e., \textit{A$[k]$}) does not change its position in the final output array.\newpage
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Partition Procedure of \texttt{Quicksort} algorithm.}
  \label{algo:ins_sort1}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{\textsc{Partition}}{\textit{A, i, j}}\newline
     \Comment{\textit{A} is an array of \textit{N} integers, \textit{A$[1..N]$}}\newline
     \Comment{\textit{i} and \textit{j} are the start and end of subarray}
      \State $x \leftarrow$ \textit{A$[i]$}
      \State $y \leftarrow$ \textit{i} - 1
      \State $\textit{z} \leftarrow$ \textit{j} + 1
      \While {(\textit{true})}
          \State $z \leftarrow z$ - 1 
          \While {$A[z] > x$} \do \newline
            \State $z \leftarrow z$ - 1 
         \EndWhile
         \State $y \leftarrow y + 1$
         \While {$A[y] > x$} \do \newline
         \State $y \leftarrow y$ + 1 
         \EndWhile
         \If{$y < z$}
            \State Swap $A[y] \leftrightarrow A[z]$
         \Else
            \State return \textit{z}
         \EndIf
      \EndWhile
   
     \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Conquer}:Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two sub-arrays. This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operations in two sub-arrays.\\
\textbf{Merge}: Quicksort does not require merge or combine operation as the entire array \textit{A$[i..j]$} is sorted in place.

In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. A pivot element \textit{x} is selected. The first inner while loop (line \#6) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element. Similarly, the second inner while loop (line \#9) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the pivot element. If indices \textit{y} and $z$ have not exchanged their side around the pivot, the elements at \textit{A$[y]$} and \textit{A$[y]$} are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure returns the index $z$, such that all elements to the left of $z$ are smaller than or equal to \textit{A$[z]$} and all elements to the right of $z$ are greater than or equal to \textit{A$[z]$}.

The main recursive procedure for \texttt{Quicksort} is\\
\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{\texttt{Quicksort} recursion.}
  \label{algo:ins_sort1}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{\textsc{Quicksort}}{\textit{A, i, j}}\newline
     \Comment{Quicksort procedure called with $A$, 1, $N$}
         \If{$i < j$}
            \State k $\leftarrow$ PARTITION \textit{(A,i,j)}
            \State \textsc{Quicksort} \textit{(A, i, k)}
            \State \textsc{Quicksort} \textit{(A, k + 1, j)}
         \EndIf
     \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}\\
presented in Algorithm 2. Initial invocation is performed by call QUICKSORT (\textit{A, 1, N}) where \textit{N} is the length of array N.      
   
\subsection{Time Complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an array of length \textit{N}, gets partitioned into two sub-arrays of size N-1 and 1 in every recursive invocation of QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm 2. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm 1, takes $\Theta(n)$ time, the recurrence relation for running time is,
\begin{center}
$T (n) = T (n - 1) +	\Theta(n)$    
\end{center}
As it is evident that $T(1) = \Theta(1)$, the recurrence is solved as follows,
\begin{center}
$T (n) = T (n - 1) +	\Theta(n)$    
$$=\sum_{k=1}^{n} \Theta(k)$$
$$=\Theta\Bigg(\sum_{k=1}^{n}k\Bigg)$$
\end{center}

Therefore, if the partitioning is always maximally unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta(n^{2})$. Intutively, if an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the recurrence for the best case is given by,
\begin{center}
$T (n) = 2T \bigg({\dfrac{n}{2}}\bigg) +	\Theta(n)$    
\end{center}
which evaluates to $\Theta(n\hspace{.2cm}log_{2} n)$. Using a comparatively involved analysis, the average running time of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be $O$($n\hspace{.25cm}lg\hspace{.25cm}n$).

\section{Lower Bounds on comparison sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms based on comparisons is the following: What is the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms? This question is important for algorithm researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.

A decision tree based analysis leads to the following theorem [1].\\

\textbf{Theorem 1.} \textit{Any decision tree that sorts n elements has height $\Omega(n\hspace{.15cm}log_{2}(n)$.}\\
\begin{proof}


\textit{Proof.} Consider a decision tree of height h that sorts \textit{n} elements. Since there are \textit{n}! permutations of \textit{n} elements, each permutation representing a distinct sorted order, the tree must have at least \textit{n}! leaves. Since a binary tree of height \textit{h} has no more than $2^{\textit{h}}$ leaves. So,\\

$\textit{n}! \leq 2^{h}$\\

Applying logarithmic ($log_{2}$), the inequality becomes,\\

$h \geq \hspace{.2cm}$lg($n!$) \\

Applying Stirling's approximations,\\

$n!\hspace{.2cm} >\hspace{.2cm}\bigg({\dfrac{n}{\epsilon}}\bigg)^{n}  $\\

where \textit{e} is natural base of logarithms. Further,\\

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
h &\geq \textmd{lg} \bigg({\dfrac{n}{\epsilon}}\bigg)^{n} \\
& = n\hspace{.15cm}\textmd{lg}\hspace{.1cm}n\hspace{.25cm}-\hspace{.25cm}n\hspace{.1cm}\textmd{lg}\hspace{.1cm}e\\
& = \Omega(n\hspace{.1cm}\textmd{lg}\hspace{.1cm}n)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{proof}
